Pact Logo
------

This is the logo to be used for both Pact (the product) and Pact Foundation (the organisation).  It's better to use it with contrasting colors (black on white or white on black) for maximum impact.  It's recommended that you use the vectorized version of the logo if possible, that is the SVG format or the Pact font, which has the chain link logo on the unicode character U+F000.

A CSS file has also been included to easily include the pact logo within HTML.  It is based on the web font available and the css must have the correct path pointing to it.  To use it within HTML, please refer to the following example:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <link href='/media/pact.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Pact Logo</h1>
    <div class="pact pact-logo"></div>
    <div class="pact pact-chain"></div>
  </body>
<html>
```
